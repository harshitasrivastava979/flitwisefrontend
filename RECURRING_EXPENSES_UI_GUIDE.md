## 🔧 Integration Instructions

### Step 1: Update Your Main App

Replace your existing expense manager with the new tabbed version:

```jsx
// In your main group details or dashboard component
import ExpenseManagerWithTabs from './components/ExpenseManagerWithTabs';

// Replace:
// <ExpenseManager groupId={groupId} />

// With:
<ExpenseManagerWithTabs groupId={groupId} onExpenseAdded={handleExpenseAdded} />
```

### Step 2: Add Dedicated Recurring View (Optional)

If you want a dedicated page for recurring expenses:

```jsx
// In your routing setup
import RecurringExpenses from './components/RecurringExpenses';

<Route path="/groups/:groupId/recurring" element={<RecurringExpenses groupId={groupId} />} />
```

### Step 3: Add Calendar View (Optional)

For a calendar-based view:

```jsx
// In your routing setup
import RecurringExpenseCalendar from './components/RecurringExpenseCalendar';

<Route path="/groups/:groupId/calendar" element={<RecurringExpenseCalendar groupId={groupId} />} />
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

## 🔄 Backend Integration

The components work with your existing backend API:

### Required API Endpoints
- `GET /api/expenses?groupId={groupId}` - Fetch all expenses
- `POST /api/addExpense` - Create new expense (supports recurring fields)

### Expected Data Structure
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "description": "Rent",
  "amount": 8000,
  "category": "Bills & Utilities",
  "recurring": true,
  "interval": "MONTHLY",
  "nextDueDate": "2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "paidByUserID": 1,
  "notes": "Monthly rent payment"
}
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Colors
You can customize the color scheme by modifying the Tailwind classes:

```jsx
// Primary color (currently teal)
className="bg-teal-600 hover:bg-teal-700"

// Status colors
className="text-red-600 bg-red-50" // Overdue
className="text-orange-600 bg-orange-50" // Due today
className="text-yellow-600 bg-yellow-50" // Due soon
```

### Icons
All components use Lucide React icons. You can replace them:

```jsx
import { Repeat, Calendar, DollarSign } from 'lucide-react';
// or
import { IconName } from 'your-icon-library';
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### 1. Efficient Filtering
- Client-side filtering for instant UI updates
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management

### 2. Lazy Loading
- Components only fetch data when mounted
- Loading states for better UX

### 3. Memoization
- Expense filtering is optimized
- Calendar calculations are cached
